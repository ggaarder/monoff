# monoff
When run via "python -m monoff", will turn off all monitors. Typing on the keyboard or moving the mouse should bring the monitors back. If your monitors auto-detect digital inputs, they will likely switch to another source if one is available. May be used to switch all monitors in one command in this manner as opposed to individually selecting sources on each monitor.
